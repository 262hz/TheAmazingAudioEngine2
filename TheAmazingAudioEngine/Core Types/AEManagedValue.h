/*!
 * Managed value
 *
 *  This class manages a mutable reference to a memory buffer or Objective-C object which is both thread-safe
 *  and realtime safe. It manages the life-cycle of the buffer/object so that it can not be deallocated
 *  while being accessed on the main thread, and does so without locking the realtime thread.
 *
 *  You can use this utility to manage a single module instance, which can be swapped out for
 *  another at any time, for instance.
 *
 *  Remember to use the __unsafe_unretained directive to avoid ARC-triggered retains on the
 *  audio thread if using this class to manage an Objective-C object, and only interact with such objects
 *  via C functions they provide, not via Objective-C methods.
