 * Message Queue
 *
 *  This class manages a two-way message queue which is used to pass messages back and

 *  an easy lock-free synchronization method, which is important when working with audio.
 *
 *  To use it, create an instance and then begin calling AEMessageQueuePoll from your render loop,
 *  in order to poll for incoming messages on the render thread. Then call startPolling on the
 *  main thread to begin polling for incoming messages on the main thread.
 *
 *  Then, use AEMessageQueuePerformOnMainThread from the audio thread, or
 *  performBlockOnAudioThread: or performBlockOnAudioThread:completionBlock: from the main thread.
