 * Main thread message handler function
 *
 *  Create functions of this type in order to handle messages from the realtime thread
 *  on the main thread. You then pass a pointer to these functions when using
 *  @link AEMessageQueue::AEMessageQueueSendMessageToMainThread AEMessageQueueSendMessageToMainThread @endlink 
 *  on the realtime thread, along with data to pass through via the userInfo parameter.
 *
 *  See @link AEMessageQueue::AEMessageQueueSendMessageToMainThread AEMessageQueueSendMessageToMainThread @endlink
 *  for further discussion.
 *
 * @param userInfo          Pointer to your data
 * @param userInfoLength    Length of userInfo in bytes

/*!
 * Message Queue
 *
 *  This class manages a two-way message queue which is used to pass messages back and
 *  forth between the audio thread and the main thread. This provides for
 *  an easy lock-free synchronization method, which is important when working with audio.
 *
 *  To use it, create an instance and then begin calling AEMessageQueuePoll from your render loop,
 *  in order to poll for incoming messages on the render thread. Then call startPolling on the
 *  main thread to begin polling for incoming messages on the main thread.
 *
 *  Then, use AEMessageQueuePerformOnMainThread from the audio thread, or
 *  performBlockOnAudioThread: or performBlockOnAudioThread:completionBlock: from the main thread.

 * Send a message to the main thread asynchronously
 *
 *  Tip: To pass a pointer (including pointers to __unsafe_unretained Objective-C objects) through the
 *  userInfo parameter, be sure to pass the address to the pointer, using the "&" prefix:
 *
 *  @code
 *  AEMessageQueueSendMessageToMainThread(queue, myMainThreadFunction, &pointer, sizeof(void*));
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  or
 *
 *  @code
 *  AEMessageQueueSendMessageToMainThread(queue, myMainThreadFunction, &object, sizeof(MyObject*));
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  You can then retrieve the pointer value via a void** dereference from your function:
 *
 *  @code
 *  void * myPointerValue = *(void**)userInfo;
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  To access an Objective-C object pointer, you also need to bridge the pointer value:
 *
 *  @code
 *  MyObject *object = (__bridge MyObject*)*(void**)userInfo;
 *  @endcode
 *
 * @param messageQueue The message queue instance.
 * @param handler A pointer to a function to call on the main thread.
 * @param data Message data (or NULL) to copy
 * @param length Length of message data
 * @return YES on success, or NO if out of buffer space or not polling
